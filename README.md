# file-tag-parser
A filename tag parser for filenames generated from custom adaptive optics ophthalmoscopes.

At the moment, the library is solely dedicated to the interpretation of complex filenames using
a "tagging system", to streamline their grouping and loading. This will likely be expanded in the future as needed.
